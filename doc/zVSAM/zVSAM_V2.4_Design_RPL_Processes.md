# zVSAM V2 - RPL-based interfaces

The RPL is the primary interface for operations at the record level.
A program can use multiple RPLs.
An RPL must always point to an open ACB in order to specify a valid operation.

## RPL macro

The RPL macro will generate an RPL and initialize it according to the parameters specified on the macro invocation.

Direct access to subfields in the RPL is discouraged. Use SHOWCB RPL=, TESTCB RPL= and/or MODCB
RPL= to inspect, test, and/or modify the RPL's content.

All keywords on the RPL macro are optional. Before a request is issued, all RPL values can be modified
using MODCB RPL=, or by changing the RPL directly. The latter is not recommended, as it is not
guaranteed to be portable or compatible with future versions of zVSAM.

The table below shows how the RPL macro can be coded

## GENCB, MODCB, TESTCB and SHOWCB macros

### GENCB, MODCB, TESTCB and SHOWCB use of the CBMR

A CBMR is generated for all forms of these macros.

Direct access to subfields in the CBMR is discouraged. Use SHOWCB, TESTCB and/or MODCB to inspect,
test, and/or modify the content of an ACB, EXLST, or RPL. Use the appropriate MF= parameter on any of
these macros to modify and/or use a CBMR.

The CBMR consists of three parts: a header, a body, and a tail. The header has a fixed layout. The body
consists of request-dependent fields and a list of verb codes. The tail contains all the data fields that go with
the verb codes. Data fields can be 0, 4 or 8 bytes in length.

Verb codes X'01'-X'DF' have a 4-byte data field
Verb codes X'E0'-X'FF' have an 8-byte data field

All data fields in the tail are allocated consecutively, in the same order as the verbs that define their meaning

#### CBMR – header

The CBMR header identifies the type (ACB, EXLST, RPL, GENCB, MODCB, SHOWCB or TESTCB)

It also has details of any work area needed and a count of verbs in CBMRVRBS

#### CBMR – body

Its length is determined by the CBMRVRBS fields in the CBMR header.
It contains one verb code for each specified parameter.

#### CBMR – tail

The body is directly followed by the tail.
It contains a data field of 4 or 8 bytes for each verb coded in the body, in the same sequence.

The starting point of the tail can be found by adding the CBMRVRBS value to the end of the CBMR header.
Its length can be calculated from the CBMRSIZE field, by subtracting both the header length and the CBMRVRBS field.

### GENCB, MODCB, TESTCB and SHOWCB use of MF=

All forms except MF=L generate executable code.

| Parameter            | Explanation                                        |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| MF=I or omitted      | Generates CBMR and invokes ZVSAM19C to process it  |
| MF=L                 | Generates CBMR inline                              |
| MF=(L,address)       | Generates CBMR inline and then moves it to address |
| MF=(L,address,label) | as above and generates label equ size              |
| MF=(E,address)       | Modifies the CBMR at address                       |
|                      | Invokes ZVSAM19C to process the CBMR               |
| MF=(G,address)       | Generates CBMR inline and then moves it to address |
|                      | Invokes ZVSAM19C to process the CBMR               |
| MF=(G,address,label) | as above and generates label equ size              |

address can be label or reg, reg cannot be 0, 1, 14 or 15. reg is not permitted for MF=L

### GENCB, MODCB, TESTCB and SHOWCB parameter types

For abs expression (called value in the macro definitions)

| Parameter type        | For MF=I/G/L                   | For MF=E                       |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| n                     | Permitted                      | Permitted                      |
| EQUated numeric value | Permitted, but not for LENGTH= | Permitted, but not for LENGTH= |

For address

| Parameter type               | For MF=I/G/L                        | For MF=E                                |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|

|                              |                                     | When n=0 see note 2                     |
| EQUated numeric value        | Permitted, but not for LENGTH=      | Permitted, but not for LENGTH=          |
|                              | See note 1                          | See note 1 here                         |
| ADCON-type address           | Permitted                           | Permitted                               |
| Register form (reg)          | Permitted, but not regs 0,1,14,15   | Permitted, but not regs 0,1,14,15       |
| Indirect form with ADCON     | Permitted for certain 8-byte fields | Permitted for certain 8-byte fields     |

| Indirect form with disp(reg) | Permitted for certain 8-byte fields | Permitted for certain 8-byte fields     |
| (\*,n(reg))                  | reg cannot be 0,1,14,15. See Note 3 | reg cannot be 0,1,14,15. See Note 3     |

*Note 1:* The use of numeric values instead of an address may lead to accessing low storage and
should be avoided

*Note 2:* An exception is TESTCB EODAD, JRNAD, LERAD and SYNAD where zero instead of an
address means 'don't test the address'

*Note 3:* The following fields only support the indirect form in TESTCB:
SDTASZ, STMST and all X\* fields.
The lack of proper syntax checking in the IBM macro can cause access to low storage or
environmental destruction, so the following syntaxes are not allowed: (\*,\*) and (\*,n)
